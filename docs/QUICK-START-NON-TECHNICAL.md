## 🆘 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### Problem: "I clicked the link but nothing happened"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're connected to the internet
2. Try copying the link and pasting it into your browser
3. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Problem: "It says Python is not installed"

**Solution (Windows):**
1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click the big yellow "Download Python" button
3. Run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"

6. Wait for it to finish
7. Try the setup again

**Solution (Mac):**
1. Open Terminal (press Cmd+Space, type "terminal", press Enter)
2. Type: `python3 --version` and press Enter
3. If it says "command not found", you need to install Python:
   - Install Homebrew: https://brew.sh
   - Then type: `brew install python3`

**OR:** Just ask a colleague or your coordinator for help!

### Problem: "I closed the window and now it doesn't work"

**Solution:**
- Run the setup again (double-click the file)
- The window needs to stay open while you use NUAA
- Minimize it instead of closing it

### Problem: "I can't find the file I created"

**Solution:**
- All files are saved in the `outputs` folder
- Ask your coordinator where this is on your computer
- Or look in: `[your-nuaa-folder]/outputs/[your-team]/[today's-date]/`

### Problem: "My team isn't listed"

**Solution:**
- Contact your coordinator - they can add your team
- Or email: tech@nuaa.org.au
