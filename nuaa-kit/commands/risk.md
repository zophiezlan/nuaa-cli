## What Gets Created

Comprehensive risk register including:
- Risk assessment framework (likelihood × impact)
- 8 risk categories with examples:
  1. Program delivery risks
  2. Stakeholder & partnership risks
  3. Financial & resource risks
  4. Staffing & HR risks
  5. Health & safety risks
  6. Ethical & legal risks
  7. Reputational risks
  8. Cultural safety risks
- Detailed mitigation strategies
- Risk summary dashboard
- Review and incident reporting processes

## Risk Assessment Framework

**Likelihood**: Rare (1) → Almost Certain (5)
**Impact**: Insignificant (1) → Severe (5)
**Risk Level**: Likelihood × Impact
- 1-4: Low (monitor)
- 5-9: Medium (manage actively)
- 10-15: High (priority action)
- 16-25: Extreme (immediate action)

## Use Cases

- Program planning and design
- Funder accountability and governance
- Quality assurance
- Continuous improvement
- Incident prevention and response

## Best Practices

1. **Start early**: Create risk register during program design
2. **Be realistic**: Don't downplay risks to look good
3. **Involve team**: Staff and peers know the real risks
4. **Review regularly**: Monthly minimum, more if high-risk program
5. **Document incidents**: Learn from what happens
6. **Update mitigation**: If strategies aren't working, try different ones
7. **Report to management**: Escalate high/extreme risks immediately
