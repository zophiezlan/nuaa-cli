# Australia's peer-led harm reduction pioneer transforms drug use response

**The NSW Users and AIDS Association (NUAA) has maintained one of the world's lowest HIV rates among people who inject drugs—below 1%—for over three decades through peer-based harm reduction.** Founded in 1989 during the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis, NUAA represents a groundbreaking model where drug policy is governed, staffed, and led entirely by people with lived experience of drug use. This approach has contributed to Australia's internationally recognized success in preventing HIV transmission while advancing the health, human rights, and dignity of one of society's most marginalized populations. Today, NUAA continues expanding services across NSW while advocating for evidence-based drug law reform, including the drug checking trial that launched in March 2025.

## 1. Organizational Overview

NUAA is a peer-based drug user organization and registered association under Fair Work, funded primarily by NSW Health for service delivery focused on harm reduction and community empowerment. The organization's defining characteristic is that it is **governed, staffed, and led by people with lived experience of drug use**—not merely consulting peers, but centering their leadership at every organizational level.

**Vision statement**: "To advance the health, human rights and dignity of people who use or have used illicit drugs."

**Core purpose**: NUAA provides education, practical support, information, and advocacy to users of illicit drugs, their friends, and allies. The organization works to prevent transmission of blood-borne viruses (BBVs) including HIV and hepatitis C, improve service delivery and system change, and advance harm reduction through peer-based approaches.

**Organizational structure**: NUAA is governed by a Board elected at the Annual General Meeting, meeting every second month. The **current Board** includes Andrew Heslop (Chair), Larry Pierce (Treasurer), Carolyn Stubley (Secretary), Daniel Burns, Jess Doumany, Michael Doyle, Richard Suvlosky, and Dr. Mary Ellen Harrod (CEO, ex officio). Board members serve two-year terms and may serve up to three terms. Any ordinary NUAA member can be nominated for the Board, which comprises professionals, researchers, and community members who reflect the community they serve.

**Key leadership**: **Dr. Mary Ellen Harrod** serves as CEO, representing NUAA in various state-level drug and alcohol and blood-borne virus committees. She made three appearances before the NSW Ice Inquiry in 2019 and was significantly involved in the NSW Coronial Inquest into deaths at music festivals. Deputy CEO **Charles Henderson** and key staff including Michelle Toy (Advocacy and Policy Lead) and Alice Pierce (Community Engagement Manager) round out the leadership team.

**Historical leadership figures** include **Julie Bates**, NUAA's first manager in 1989, who was instrumental in establishing the organization and later awarded Officer of the Order of Australia (AO). **Annie Madden**, CEO from 1996-2000, went on to lead the Australian Injecting & Illicit Drugs Users League and was awarded AO in 2019. **Jude Byrne**, the globally recognized former Board Chair, passed away in 2021 after years of powerful advocacy.

**Locations**: Main office at 267 Broadway, NSW 2037; primary Needle and Syringe Program at 345 Crown Street, Surry Hills, NSW 2010; and outreach services across multiple NSW Local Health Districts including Exchange on Parker at Nepean Hospital.

## 2. Historical Context and Evolution

### The HIV/AIDS crisis and NUAA's founding

NUAA emerged from one of Australia's most critical public health emergencies. In the early 1980s, HIV rapidly spread among Sydney's gay community, with HIV diagnoses peaking at 2,773 cases in 1987 and AIDS diagnoses reaching 909 in 1994. Healthcare workers at St. Vincent's Hospital faced a terrifying prospect: HIV spreading from gay men who used drugs to heterosexual injecting drug users through needle sharing, then to the broader community through sexual contact. International examples were sobering—in Thailand, HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs increased from less than 1% to over 40% in just ten months in 1987.

The situation in NSW was dire. People were "sharpening syringes on matchboxes because of the lack of supply." Syringe sharing was nearly 100% in 1986. Yet providing needles and syringes to people who use drugs remained illegal, with police and politicians arguing it would increase drug use and send the wrong message.

**On November 12-13, 1986, Dr. Alex Wodak and colleagues at St. Vincent's Hospital committed an act of civil disobedience**: they established an illegal pilot needle and syringe program in Darlinghurst, fixing a note to their building door: "If you would like a clean needle and syringe, free, press this buzzer." This self-funded program, supported by staff, activists, people who used drugs, the Sisters of Charity, and ultimately NSW Police (who refrained from arrests), marked the beginning of Australia's harm reduction revolution.

The government quickly followed. In December 1986, NSW Department of Health established a legal drug store-based needle distribution scheme. By early 1987, official Needle and Syringe Exchange Programs operated across major cities. Critically, a group of injecting drug users from Darlinghurst had mobilized in response to HIV in the early-to-mid 1980s, forming the **AIDS Drugs Information Collective (ADIC)** and consulting with Dr. Wodak's team about the initial NSP.

**In 1989, ADIC became the NSW Users and AIDS Association (NUAA)**, establishing the largest government-funded drug user organization in Australia at the time. Julie Bates was appointed as the first manager. The founding principle was clear: effective drug policy cannot exclude the voices of people who use drugs. Peers with direct experience understand the issues and are listened to seriously by other peers.

### Evolution and major milestones

NUAA has systematically expanded from distributing illegal sterile equipment to becoming a comprehensive peer organization offering health services, education, advocacy, and support:

**1991**: First issue of NUAA News published, passing on harm reduction information and assuring readers "you are not alone."

**1998**: NUAA News evolved into **User's News**, a nationally distributed magazine featuring writing by and for peers that has now been published for over 30 years.

**1999**: NUAA and Dr. Wodak were instrumental in establishing Australia's first Medically Supervised Injecting Centre in Kings Cross when it was pre-legal.

**2000s**: Partnership with Justice Health to publish Insider's News for incarcerated people; development of peer-based education and support programs.

**2010**: Launch of **DanceWize NSW** to provide peer-based harm reduction at festivals, offering Crowd Care, Education, Roving, Training, and Advocacy.

**2011**: Establishment of NUAA's Hall of Fame, recognizing groundbreaking work advancing the health, rights, and dignity of people who use illicit drugs.

**2018**: Launch of **PeerLine**, a confidential peer-run telephone service providing support to people who use drugs, those on opioid treatment programs, or seeking treatment across NSW.

**2019**: Major policy involvement in the NSW Ice Inquiry (written submission, roundtable discussions, supporting individual testimony) and the NSW Coronial Inquest into deaths at music festivals.

**2020**: New NUAA Constitution voted in at Annual General Meeting.

**2020s**: Program expansion including **ConnectED** (specialist peer support and professional development for the lived/living experience AOD workforce), expansion of Needle and Syringe Programs across regional, rural, and remote NSW, Open Clinic on Crown (nurse-led primary health care clinic at the NSP), and stigma and discrimination training for health care professionals.

**2023-2025**: Active advocacy culminating in the 12-month drug checking trial starting March 2025; ongoing Peers On Wheels (POW) mobile hepatitis C testing; and participation in the 2024 NSW Drug Summit.

### Impact on Australia's HIV response

Without needle and syringe programs and peer-based responses, an estimated **additional 9,100 cases of HIV would have occurred from 2006-2016 in NSW alone**. Approximately 55% of total life years saved from HIV prevention in NSW relate to injecting drug users, representing approximately 394,000 life years expected to be gained. As Annie Madden, former NUAA CEO, stated: "Peer-organizations like [NUAA] are essential to the success of programs like the NSP." Julie Bates emphasized: "NSPs wouldn't have worked alone, it was their implementation alongside peer-based responses that curbed an Australian HIV epidemic."

## 3. Core Programs and Services

NUAA operates a comprehensive suite of harm reduction programs and services across NSW, all grounded in peer-based approaches.

### Needle and Syringe Programs

**Fixed-site NSP** at 345 Crown Street, Surry Hills operates Monday-Friday 8:30am-6:30pm and Saturday 10am-3pm. **NUAA runs the only peer-staffed NSP in NSW**, with staff who have lived experience of injecting drug use making them knowledgeable and non-judgmental. The service reports lower rates of receptive sharing than equivalent NSPs in the area. Services are anonymous and free, providing sterile injecting equipment, health promotion, brief interventions, and gateway access to other health and welfare services.

**Peer Distribution Program**: This secondary distribution model has peers distribute sterile injecting equipment to other people who inject drugs in their local community. Successfully implemented across various Local Health Districts in NSW, peers receive one-on-one training, advice, and support as they develop into "peer professionals" who pass knowledge, empowerment, safety, and right-to-health approaches through their networks. As equipment is distributed through local networks, so too is information about BBV prevention, testing, treatment, safer use, overdose response, and prevention of injection-related injuries.

**Outreach NSP Services**: Operating in southwestern Sydney and other regions, including home delivery and pickup of used equipment, targeting people with limited access to established NSP providers. Services operate in multiple Local Health Districts including Nepean Blue Mountains LHD, where Aboriginal Peer Workers provide services at Exchange on Parker at Nepean Hospital.

**Postal services**: For people in regional, rural, and remote locations with limited access to harm reduction services.

### Peer support services

**PeerLine**: Confidential peer-run telephone service (1800 644 413, free; or 02 8354 7300) operating Monday-Friday 9:00am-5:00pm. Staffed entirely by peers, PeerLine provides support to people who use drugs, those on opioid treatment programs, or seeking treatment across NSW. Services include accessing harm reduction services/advice, treatment information, mediation with health professionals and service providers, and guidance through complaints processes.

**Peer Link Project**: Operating in approximately 10 locations across NSW, including recent expansion to Moree. Brings groups together to provide harm reduction information on preventing overdose, prevention of blood-borne virus transmission, safer using techniques, and how to engage and connect with services.

**Hepatitis C Buddy Program**: Links people who have been through hepatitis C treatment to support and mentor people currently considering treatment. Uses the empathy and support that comes from peer-to-peer connections, which can often be the turning point in taking action. Buddies accompany people to medical appointments, and after successful treatment, buddies are trained to become mentors themselves, spreading out the support structure.

**Peer Participation Program**: Aims to establish peers within NSPs and other settings, providing practical tools and strategies for establishing peer connections, building trust, and developing partnerships vital to supporting the health and life journey of people who inject drugs. Starts at Crown Street NSP with a volunteer team and serves as the "bedrock" where fundamentals of "peer professionalism" are established, including committing to a Code of Conduct and developing communication skills, record-keeping, and boundaries.

### Education and training programs

NUAA delivers extensive peer-led training covering hygiene and safer use, vein care, recognizing and responding to overdose, how to use naloxone, blood-borne viruses, infection control, stigma and discrimination, and navigating health services. These intensive two-day workshops provide practical skills for peers in the community.

**ConnectED**: A free professional development network for people in the lived or living experience alcohol and other drugs workforce in NSW. Components include:

- **GROW**: Community of Practice sessions delivered in partnership with expert peer consultants
- **EXPAND**: Webinar series with leading AOD sector experts
- **CONNECT**: Online support network with resources, advice, and information forums
- Provides tailored training, comprehensive peer support, and a dynamic online community

NUAA also provides training presentations as part of NSW's accredited opioid pharmacotherapy treatment prescriber training through OTAC, "to provide a living/lived experience perspective" to medical professionals.

**Take-Home Naloxone Program**: Training and naloxone kit provision with brief interventions on overdose recognition and response, part of the state-wide program to prevent fatal overdoses.

### Advocacy work

NUAA sits on approximately 10 regularly occurring NSW Ministry of Health committees, including Hepatitis and HIV Strategies implementation committees and the Drug and Alcohol Program Council, plus multiple time-limited committees. The organization makes regular submissions to government inquiries, speaks at rallies and conferences, and provides professional development presentations.

**Recent advocacy victories** include being integral to establishing the 12-month drug checking trial that launched in March 2025, contributing to Early Drug Diversion Initiative reforms, and securing government commitment to a 10-year Alcohol and Other Drug Strategy based on harm minimization principles.

NUAA's 2024 Drug Summit position paper called for decriminalization of personal drug possession and use, expansion of supervised injecting centers beyond Kings Cross, needle and syringe programs in prisons, ending drug detection dogs and strip searches at festivals, drug checking services, and a long-term AOD strategy. While some recommendations were adopted, others—particularly around decriminalization, prison NSP, and ending strip searches—remain unaddressed.

### Health promotion activities

**DanceWize NSW**: Peer-based harm reduction at music festivals providing Crowd Care, Education, Roving services, Training, and Advocacy. In one year, rovers engaged with 99,350 patrons at 22 festivals. Notably, 17% of care episodes were referred by rovers, and 35% of people referred to medical services were brought in by rovers. DanceWize now works alongside the drug checking trial launched in March 2025.

**Peers On Wheels (POW)**: Mobile hepatitis C testing model co-developed with The Kirby Institute, NSW Health, and Local Health Districts. This peer-led approach brings point-of-care testing and treatment to areas where needed most, featuring peer-supported engagement, financial incentives, and linkage to care to enhance treatment uptake. The model specifically targets people with limited access to mainstream services and is designed to reduce stigma and barriers.

**Open Clinic on Crown**: A nurse-led primary health care clinic co-located at NUAA's NSP at 345 Crown Street, Surry Hills, providing accessible healthcare without stigma.

**Hepatitis C elimination initiatives**: NUAA works toward NSW Health's goal of eliminating hepatitis C by 2028 through a partnership approach where peers work alongside clinical services. This includes point-of-care testing using finger-stick technology, support for Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) treatment, and removing barriers to sustained viral response (SVR).

### Publications and resources

**User's News** (www.usersnews.com.au): NUAA's flagship magazine, published since 1991, is "written by people who use drugs for other people who use drugs" covering harm reduction tips, stigma and discrimination, advocacy updates, hepatitis C and HIV information, police practices and drug policy, festival safety, and treatment options. Recent 2024 articles include steroid use harm reduction, alternative peer support groups, drugs and consent, workplace drug testing advice, hep C elimination updates, and Drug Summit coverage.

**Insider's News**: Magazine for people in correctional facilities, providing harm reduction information adapted for jail settings, distributed directly to prisons.

**Research reports and position papers**: Including "What helps and what hurts: perspectives on clinical care from people who use drugs and alcohol in NSW" (Dr. Mary Ellen Harrod et al, 2022), commissioned by NSW Health; NUAA Drug Summit Position Paper (August 2024); "Language Matters" guide (NUAA & NADA, 2018) offering person-centered alternatives to stigmatizing language; and numerous submissions on drug policy issues.

**Harm reduction resources**: Information sheets on overdose response, naloxone use, vein care, blood-borne virus prevention, and safer use guidelines, all available online and at the NSP.

**Drug alerts**: Active monitoring and dissemination of drug warnings, including May 2025 high dose MDMA pills, March 2025 fake oxycodone with N-desethyl isotonitazene, and multiple high-dose MDMA warnings throughout 2023-2025.

**Annual reports and strategic plans**: Available dating back to 2010-11, including the current Strategic Plan 2025-29.

## 4. Target Population and Community

NUAA serves **people who use or have used illicit drugs in New South Wales**, with particular focus on **people who inject drugs (PWID)**—especially those using opioids, methamphetamine, and other injectable substances. The constituency includes current drug users (those actively using), people with living experience (currently using), people with lived experience (those who have used in the past), people on opioid treatment programs (methadone, buprenorphine), people in correctional facilities who use or have used drugs, and festival-goers and event attendees who may use drugs.

NUAA provides statewide NSW coverage including Sydney metropolitan areas and regional/rural NSW, with services operating in multiple Local Health Districts and recent expansion to locations like Moree.

### Demographics and context

According to the 2022-23 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, **17.5% of people in NSW had used an illicit drug in the previous 12 months**—more than 1 in 6 people. Almost 1 in 2 Australians (47%) have used an illicit drug in their lifetime. Cannabis remains the most commonly used illicit drug. Recent changes include cocaine use increasing from 68% to 80% among regular stimulant users between 2020-2021, and ketamine use increasing from 0.8% to 1.4%.

Drug use crosses all demographics: young adults (18-25 years) are most likely to use illicit drugs, but use is reasonably equally distributed across socioeconomic groups. Notably, people in the paid workforce have higher lifetime drug use (51%) than unemployed people (43%), and people with post-school qualifications have higher rates (47%) than those without (34%). The North Coast NSW had the highest proportion of illicit drug users (23%), while Northern Sydney had the lowest (11%).

### Specific vulnerable subpopulations

NUAA explicitly states they "strive to improve our advocacy for, and services supporting, the diversity of people impacted by stigma and discrimination caused by the criminalisation of drug use across NSW." This includes particular attention to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who face disproportionate impacts from drug criminalization, women who use drugs (NUAA notes they "need to devote particular attention to meaningfully including women who use drugs"), people with hepatitis C (approximately 90% of people living with HCV in Australia are people who inject drugs), LGBTQI+ people who use drugs, and young people, particularly those attending music festivals.

As NUAA states in their materials: "We are your sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters."

## 5. Approach and Philosophy

NUAA operates from a **harm reduction/harm minimisation framework** grounded in justice and human rights. Their approach focuses on "reducing the harms associated with drug use while respecting the rights of people to make decisions for themselves and recognize where they're at. And we empower them to do things to look after their health."

### Harm reduction principles

According to Harm Reduction International's definition cited in NUAA contexts: "Harm reduction is grounded in justice and human rights. It focuses on positive change and on working with people without judgement, coercion, discrimination, or requiring that they stop using drugs as a precondition of support."

NUAA's specific harm reduction methodology includes:

1. **Non-judgmental engagement**: Meeting people "where they are at" in their relationship with drugs
2. **Self-determination and empowerment**: Respecting people's right to make their own decisions about drug use
3. **Health focus**: Prioritizing health outcomes over abstinence mandates
4. **Evidence-based interventions**: Relying on proven strategies like NSPs, naloxone distribution, hepatitis C treatment
5. **Community-driven**: Services designed and delivered by the community they serve

NUAA emphasizes that harm reduction requires "a collaborative, multi-layered approach of drug education, peer-to-peer support, drug-checking/pill-testing and health services." The organization uses specific economic arguments: "For every needle and syringe that's handed out the Health Department saves $4 straight up, and $12 indirectly." The NSP is described as "one of the most cost-effective strategies available."

### Peer-based model philosophy

NUAA describes itself as a "peer-based drug user organisation"—this is not just a service delivery method but an organizational identity. The organization is "governed, staffed and led by people with lived experience of drug use."

According to NUAA's acting CEO Yvonne Samuel in a 2017 interview: "It's critical. There's a whole heap of organisations out there that provide education that they've obtained through books. Lots of organisations. And in no way have they not got a place. They're very important. However, **lived experience is an expert knowledge that you can't get from books**. And it's respected within the community of people who inject drugs and use drugs – recognising people who are their own."

"So when they talk harm reduction information to other people who know they've been there, done that, or are currently doing it, it tends to have kudos. And that allows those messages to spread."

**The power of shared language and understanding**: "It's got to do with understanding language more than anything else. People recognise you're part of that community. They'll drop a sentence and you'll both have a mutual understanding of what that comment meant. And so, it allows doorways to open and then from that for it to spread deeper into a network in a particular region."

As stated on NUAA's website: "Peers draw upon their own lived experience to provide authentic engagement and support for people accessing harm reduction services. Peers are in a unique position to build connections and rapport with people who use and inject drugs and can increase uptake of hepatitis C prevention, testing and treatment, ensuring the appropriate messaging reaches affected communities."

NUAA emphasizes: "Most information within injecting communities is peer provided to start with. What we're doing is ensuring that the information provided is accurate – instead of myth perpetuating."

### Human rights framework and stance on prohibition

NUAA operates from an explicit human rights framework. When asked about people who say drug users forgo their rights, acting CEO Yvonne Samuel stated emphatically: **"Nobody forgoes their human rights. Being human is what gives you the right to have access to human rights. That's my response to people who say that. That's why they're called human rights. Not good people rights or well-behaved people rights. They're for everybody."**

**Position on decriminalization**: NUAA called for decriminalization of personal possession and use of illicit drugs in their position paper to the 2024 NSW Drug Summit. They state: "The criminal justice response to drug use continues to perpetuate stigma, discrimination, and systemic inequality."

In their submission to the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act review, NUAA opposes Section 49 PA which makes discrimination against people who use illicit drugs lawful in certain contexts, arguing this exception "is in breach of Australia's International Human Rights obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)."

**Harms of criminalization**: NUAA explicitly identifies harms caused by drug laws and policing. Redfern Legal Centre data shows 82,471 people strip searched over 10 years, with only 1.43% convicted of supply—practices NUAA describes as "inherently humiliating and degrading." Drug detection dogs only result in finding illicit substances 40% of the time. NSW Police budget for "supply reduction" is 40 times higher than harm reduction spending but is "spent traumatising thousands of people while having almost no effect on drug supply." NUAA notes: "Criminalisation, over-policing, strip searches, and stigma cause enormous harm to our community, and these harms are preventable."

### "Nothing About Us Without Us"

NUAA is a signatory to and proponent of the international "Nothing About Us Without Us" manifesto, prepared by people who use drugs and endorsed by the International Network of People Who Use Drugs. The manifesto states people who use drugs demand to "be meaningfully involved at all levels of the organizations that provide services to us; be included in consultative processes, as well as in decision-making or policy-making bodies and advisory structures dealing with issues affecting us."

The manifesto declares: "We are among the most vilified and demonized groups in society. Simply because we use illegal drugs, people and governments often deny us our rights and dignity. We are the 'junkies' and 'crackheads' of the popular media. We are tagged as 'undeserving troublemakers' even among some of those who provide services to us. We are regularly excluded from the decisions that affect our lives and those of our brothers and sisters. We are your sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters. Today, we demand to have a say."

NUAA embodies the principle that **lived experience is expert knowledge**—not merely consultation but leadership and governance by people who use drugs. The organizational structure ensures: "Our staff, Board of Governance and volunteers reflect the community we serve, and we work to have the peer voice at the centre of all our work."

## 6. Impact and Achievements

### Public health impact: HIV prevention

Australia has maintained **HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs below 1%**—one of the lowest rates globally—compared to 9% in the United States. NSW recorded only **4-6 new HIV diagnoses per year among people who inject drugs** (2015-2019), with HIV incidence rate at 0.11 per 100 person-years (1995-2012), described as "extremely low and sustained."

Australia is one of only four countries globally (along with Austria, Netherlands, and Norway) with high coverage of both needle/syringe programs and opioid substitution therapy. NUAA is explicitly recognized as contributing to "Australia having one of the lowest HIV rates amongst injecting drug users in the world."

### Measurable program outcomes

**TEMPO Pilot Study** (published 2023): This interventional cohort study evaluating single-visit test and treat intervention at NUAA's peer-led NSP (September 2019-February 2021) produced remarkable results:

- 101 participants with recent injecting drug use (median age 43; 31% female)
- **27% tested HCV RNA positive**
- **81% treatment uptake** (20 of 27 initiated treatment; 2 initiated outside study)
- **45% initiated treatment same visit**
- **50% initiated treatment within 1-2 days**
- **89% sustained virological response (SVR)** in evaluable population
- **100% acceptability** of receiving treatment at an NSP
- **78% willing** to discuss health with a peer NSP worker
- **95% preferred same-day HCV test results**

Published in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Drug Policy, this was described as "one of the first studies globally" to evaluate finger-stick hepatitis C testing with same-day treatment and peer-based support. The success led to scale-up of the point-of-care testing model.

**TEMPO Partnership Project**: A $2.2 million multi-centre, practice-level, cluster randomised controlled trial (currently ongoing) represents a world-first study comparing point-of-care HCV RNA testing, dried blood spot testing, and standard of care, evaluating treatment uptake among people with recent injecting drug use at NSPs. The study has "potential to change clinical practice, health policy, and the lives of people living with hepatitis C in Australia and globally."

**DanceWize NSW outcomes**: Rovers engaged with 99,350 patrons at 22 festivals in one year. Notably, 17% of care episodes were referred by rovers, and 35% of people referred to medical services were brought in by rovers, demonstrating the value of peer-based festival harm reduction.

### Policy changes influenced

**Drug checking trial (2025)**: NUAA was described as "integral to making this happen" after years of advocacy. Their expertise and community lived/living experience was "central to shaping the trial." The 12-month trial launched at Yours and Owls festival in Wollongong (March 1-2, 2025), with a second trial at Midnight Mafia (May 3, 2025), and up to ten additional festivals planned. Data from drug checking is used to support drug alert information.

**Early Drug Diversion Initiative (EDDI) reforms**: NUAA advocacy contributed to government commitment to address restrictions around possession of multiple drugs, criminal history barriers, and threshold quantities. NUAA identified police discretionary powers as a key barrier to fair implementation.

**10-Year Alcohol and Other Drug Strategy (2024)**: Long-standing NUAA and sector advocacy resulted in government commitment to a comprehensive strategy based on harm minimization principles.

**Foundation role in Australian HIV response**: Established 1989 during HIV epidemic, NUAA mobilized alongside harm minimization adoption as national drug policy (1985) and contributed to Australia's first National HIV/AIDS Strategy (1989). NUAA and peer-based responses "curbed an Australian HIV epidemic."

### Recognition and research contributions

NUAA is funded by NSW Health (ongoing since 1989) and holds partnership status with NSW Health and Local Health Districts. The organization is co-investigator on major research studies with The Kirby Institute and UNSW, with publications in peer-reviewed journals including International Journal of Drug Policy, Viruses, and The Lancet.

Research studies evaluating NUAA's work include the TEMPO Pilot Study (2023), TEMPO HCV Awareness Study (2022), and participation in the National Australian Hepatitis C Point-of-Care Testing Program (2023). NUAA is cited in academic literature as contributing to Australia's world-leading harm reduction response and recognized for "innovative approaches to peer education and community development."

**Historical impact**: Without needle and syringe programs and peer-based responses, an estimated additional 9,100 cases of HIV would have occurred from 2006-2016 in NSW. Approximately 55% of total life years saved from HIV prevention in NSW relate to injecting drug users, representing approximately 394,000 life years expected to be gained over the lifetime of people avoiding HIV.

## 7. Partnerships and Collaborations

NUAA operates through an extensive network of partnerships across government, health services, research institutions, and community organizations.

### Government agencies

**NSW Health**: Primary funder providing core funding for service delivery. Key partnerships include:

- Drug Checking Trial partnership (launched March 2025)
- Fast-Track Cities Initiative signatory (Paris Declaration on Fast-Track Cities to end HIV epidemics by 2030)
- Hepatitis C elimination goal collaboration (targeting 2028)
- Commissioning of research including "What Helps and What Hurts" report (2022)

**NSW Ministry of Health committees**: NUAA sits on approximately 10 regularly occurring committees including Hepatitis and HIV Strategies implementation committees and the Drug and Alcohol Program Council, plus multiple time-limited committees.

**Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care**: Collaboration on the National Drug Strategy (2017), a 10-year framework for addressing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use.

### Health services and research institutions

**The Kirby Institute**: Major research partnership on the Peers On Wheels (POW) project, TEMPO Pilot Study, TEMPO Partnership Project, and National Australian Hepatitis C Point-of-Care Testing Program. NUAA staff serve as co-investigators on multiple studies.

**Local Health Districts**: Multiple LHD partnerships across NSW including Nepean Blue Mountains LHD (outreach services in Penrith, Blue Mountains, and Hawkesbury regions based at Exchange on Parker at Nepean Hospital with Aboriginal Peer Workers).

**Sydney North Health Network**: Collaboration to produce video resources as practical tools for health professionals providing care to people who use drugs or alcohol.

**Justice Health**: Partnership to publish Insider's News magazine for people in correctional facilities.

### NGOs and community organizations

**ACON (LGBTQIA+ Health Organization)**: Joint advocacy partner on drug policy reform; co-called for dedicated Taskforce to oversee Drug Summit implementation (November 2024); partner in Fast-Track Cities HIV elimination initiative.

**Network of Alcohol and Other Drugs Agencies (NADA)**: Key advocacy partner; co-called for Drug Summit implementation Taskforce; collaborated on "Language Matters" guide (2018).

**Hepatitis NSW**: Formal partnership for hepatitis C elimination efforts.

**Bobby Goldsmith Foundation & Positive Life NSW**: Partners in Fast-Track Cities agreement for HIV elimination.

## 8. Challenges and Current Issues

### Treatment access gap

The 2024 Drug Summit Report found that an estimated **101,773 people in NSW need treatment but aren't getting it**—a critical gap requiring better resourcing and coordination to address complex presentations involving mental health, housing, and other needs.

### Stigma and discrimination

NSW Health and NGO workforce stigmatization toward people experiencing harm from alcohol and other drug use remains prevalent (2021 research by Zest). Continued barriers to accessing health services persist despite NUAA's extensive stigma reduction efforts. As NUAA peer worker Tony McNaughton stated: "Peers don't have a GP. Often if they go to a doctor, it's the emergency room, and more often than not, people don't go to doctors because of the stigma and discrimination." For peers who have faced repeated stigma and discrimination in health settings, "accessing care inside NUAA's NSP versus going to a different service up the road can be the difference between disengaging and connecting with care."

### Service delivery barriers

People in regional, rural, and remote locations face challenges accessing equipment, resources, and services. NUAA actively recruits peers in these locations to address this gap.

### Hepatitis C elimination barriers

Hepatitis C transmission in prisons remains a major barrier to achieving NSW Health's 2028 elimination goal. Despite NUAA advocacy, there are still no needle and syringe programs in correctional settings.

### Controversial policy issues

**Drug detection dogs and strip searches**: NUAA's major disappointment with the 2024 Drug Summit was the government's rejection of recommendations to cease drug detection dogs and strip searches at festivals despite evidence of harm. Data shows 82,471 people strip searched over 10 years with only 1.43% convicted of supply, and drug dog searches only resulted in finding illicit substances 40% of the time. NUAA criticized this as undermining the drug checking services they helped establish, causing trauma to young people with minimal effectiveness.

**Early Drug Diversion Initiative (EDDI) low uptake**: Since EDDI began in February 2024, only 6.4% of people were offered diversion. NUAA identified police discretionary powers as a key barrier to fair implementation. Historical data shows racial and socioeconomic disparities: Non-Indigenous people are 4x more likely to receive caution; 75% in North Sydney got cautions versus 24% in Upper Hunter Shire.

**Decriminalization**: Despite NUAA's position paper advocating for decriminalization of personal possession and use of illicit drugs, the government made no movement on this issue following the 2024 Drug Summit.

**Supervised injecting centers**: No commitment to expand supervised injecting facilities beyond the existing Kings Cross location, despite NUAA advocacy.

**Prison NSP**: No action on providing sterile injecting equipment in correctional settings despite this being a major barrier to hepatitis C elimination.

## 9. Current Status and Recent Developments (2023-2025)

### Drug checking trial launch (March 2025)

The 12-month drug checking trial represents a major victory for NUAA after years of advocacy. The trial launched at Yours and Owls festival in Wollongong (March 1-2, 2025), with the second trial at Midnight Mafia festival (May 3, 2025), and up to ten additional festivals planned. The service is free and anonymous, staffed by peer workers, health workers, and analysts. NUAA peer workers are integral to service delivery, and data from drug checking is used to support drug alert information.

### 2024 NSW Drug Summit

Over 700 Summit participants and 3,669 written submissions contributed to the Summit. The government supported or supported "in principle" over 50 of 56 recommendations. NUAA worked to ensure voices of people with lived/living experience were represented and published detailed analysis highlighting both progress and disappointments.

NUAA celebrated wins including the 10-year Alcohol and Other Drug Strategy commitment, drug checking trial, EDDI reforms, medicinal cannabis driving defense investigation, and investment in AOD services and naloxone availability. However, major disappointments included continued drug detection dogs and strip searches at festivals, no movement on decriminalization, no commitment to expand supervised injecting centers, and no prison NSP.

### Ongoing innovations

**Peers On Wheels (POW) Project**: This innovative peer-led mobile hepatitis C testing model continues expanding across regional, rural, and remote NSW, featuring point-of-care testing, peer-supported engagement, financial incentives, and linkage to care.

**ConnectED expansion**: The free professional development network for people in the lived/living experience AOD workforce continues growing with GROW Community of Practice sessions, EXPAND webinar series, and CONNECT online support network.

**Dried Blood Spot (DBS) Testing**: NUAA became an authorized DBS Site, offering less invasive hepatitis C and HIV testing with no vein puncture required—a low-threshold, convenient testing method.

**Strategic planning**: NUAA published its Strategic Plan 2025-29 and Annual Report 2024-25.

### Drug alerts and harm reduction messaging

NUAA continues active drug alert dissemination:

- May 2025: High dose MDMA pills detected

## Conclusion

The NSW Users and AIDS Association represents one of the world's most successful peer-led harm reduction organizations, demonstrating that effective responses to drug use must be designed and led by the people most affected. Over 36 years, NUAA has evolved from a group of drug users mobilizing against HIV in the 1980s to a comprehensive, government-funded organization delivering services across NSW while maintaining its founding principle: "Nothing About Us Without Us."

NUAA's approach is distinguished by structural integration of peer leadership at every level, harm reduction without preconditions, an explicit human rights framework, evidence-based advocacy using data and research, community empowerment building capacity within the drug using community, and multi-strategy integration of service delivery, peer education, policy advocacy, and research. The organization challenges prohibition while working within current legal frameworks, actively advocating for decriminalization and law reform.

The evidence of impact is compelling: HIV prevalence below 1% among people who inject drugs in Australia (compared to 9% in the US), 81% treatment uptake in the TEMPO study with 89% sustained virological response, prevention of an estimated 9,100 HIV cases from 2006-2016 in NSW, and approximately 394,000 life years expected to be gained. As Julie Bates stated: "NSPs wouldn't have worked alone, it was their implementation alongside peer-based responses that curbed an Australian HIV epidemic."

Current challenges remain significant: 101,773 people in NSW need treatment but aren't getting it, stigma and discrimination continue limiting healthcare access, government rejection of evidence-based reforms on strip searches and decriminalization undermines progress, and low EDDI uptake reveals systemic barriers. Yet NUAA continues advancing with the drug checking trial launched March 2025, Peers On Wheels expanding hepatitis C testing across regional NSW, ConnectED developing the peer workforce, and persistent advocacy for evidence-based drug law reform grounded in harm reduction and human rights.

NUAA embodies the principle that people who use drugs are not merely recipients of services but experts with lived knowledge who must lead efforts to address drug-related harms. This is not only more effective but a matter of fundamental human rights and dignity. As NUAA's vision statement declares: "To advance the health, human rights and dignity of people who use or have used illicit drugs." After 36 years, this mission continues driving Australia's internationally recognized harm reduction success.
